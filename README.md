# Purpose of the project
The aim of this project is to create an automatic exam corrector application for TOEIC (in the first place, we will then add more tests such as Cambridge FIRST).
In the first place, the aim is to automatically correct TOEIC exams.
This project is still in realization.

### Composition of a TOEIC:
- In 2 parts : has 100 questions about oral comprehension and 100 questions about written comprehension. Each question is a checkbox with 4 possibles answer, and only one of them is correct.  
However, this application is supposed to support customisable TOEIC projdects where you can have a different possible number of boxes to tick, or simply more or fewer questions than a traditional TOEIC.

La partie openCV est encore difficile mais est l'actuelle priorit√© du projet.
